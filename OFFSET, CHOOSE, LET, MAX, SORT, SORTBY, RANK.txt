OFFSET Function: 
➤ The OFFSET function in Excel returns a cell or range of cells that is a given number of rows and columns from a given cell or range.
Syntax:
➤ The syntax of the OFFSET function is as follows: =OFFSET(reference,rows,cols,[height], [width])
• The first 3 arguments are required and the last 2 are optional.
Required arguments:
• Reference - a cell or a range of adjacent cells from which you base the offset. You can think of it as the starting point.
• Rows - The number of rows to move from the starting point, up or down. If rows is a positive number, the formula moves below the starting reference, in case of a negative number it goes above the starting reference.
• Cols - The number of columns you want the formula to move from the starting point. As well as rows, cols can be positive (to the right of the starting reference) or negative (to the left of the starting reference).
Optional arguments:
• Height - the number of rows to return.
• Width - the number of columns to return.
Both the height and width arguments must always be positive numbers. If either is omitted, it defaults to the height or width of reference.

OFFSET formula example:
=OFFSET(A1,3,1)
1. =offset (A1,4,1)
2. =offset (A1,E2,1)
3. =offset (A9,-1,1)
4. =offset (A12,3,1,1,3)
5. =sum(offset(A12,3,1,1,3))


CHOOSE function:
➤ The Excel CHOOSE function returns a value from a list using a given position or index.
Syntax:
=CHOOSE(index_num,value1,[value2],...)
index num - The value to choose. A number between 1 and 254.
value1 - The first value from which to choose.
value2 - [optional] The second value from which to choose.
CHOOSE formula example:
=choose(if(A2=5,1,if(A2=4,2,if(A2=3,3,if(A2=2,4,5)))),"Excellent","GOOD","Average", "Poor","Terrible")


LET FUNCTION:
➤ The Excel LET function allows you to assign names to calculation results and define variables inside a formula, so that the formula looks clearer and works faster.
Syntax:
LET (name1, name_value1, [name2], [name_value2], ..., calculation)
Where:
Name1 (required) - the first name to assign. It must begin with a letter.
Name_value1 (required) - the value or calculation assigned to name1.
Name2 / name_value2 (optional) - the second name and value.
Calculation (required) - a calculation that uses assigned names and values.
The function can process up to 126 name/value pairs.
LET Function Formula:
=let(x, B2,y, B3,x*y) or =LET(x, 2, у, 5, x*y)


MAX Function:
➤ The MAX function is a premade function in Excel, which finds the highest number in a range. The function ignores cells with text. It will only work for cells with numbers.
Note: There is another function called MIN, which finds the lowest value in a
range, the opposite of MAX.
➤ How to use the =MAX function:
➤ Type =MАХ
➤ Double click the MAX command
➤ Select a range (C2:C7)
➤ Hit enter
Formula: = Max(C2:C7)


SORT Function:
➤ Ranges can be sorted using the Sort Ascending and Sort Descending commands.
➤ Sort Ascending: from smallest to largest.
➤ Sort Descending: from largest to smallest.
➤ The sort commands work for text too, using A-Z order.
Note: To sort a range that has more than one column, the whole range has to be selected. Sorting just one can breaks the relationship between columns. 
Sort in the range A2:D22 by their Name, ascending from smallest to largest (A-Z).
1. Select A2:D22
2. Open the Sort & Filter menu
3. Click Sort Ascending
Note: A1 is not included as it is the header for the column. This is the row that is dedicated to
the filter. Including it will blend it with the rest.
=sort (A2:D22)


SORTBY Function :
The SORTBY function in Excel is designed to sort one range or array based on the values in another range or array. Sorting can be done by one or multiple columns.
Syntax:
SORTBY(array, by_array1, [sort_order1], [by_array2, sort_order2],...)
Array (required) - the range of cells or array of values to be sorted.
By_array1 (required) - the range or array to sort by.
Sort_order1 (optional) - the sorting order:
1 or omitted (default) - ascending
-1 - descending
Important note! Currently the SORTBY function is only available with Microsoft 365
subscriptions and Excel 2021. In Excel 2019, Excel 2016 and earlier versions the SORTBY
function is not available.
Formula:
=SORTBY (A2:B10, B2:B10, -1)
• Array is A2:A10 - since you do not wish the Value column to be displayed in the results, you leave it out of the array.
• By_array1 is B2:B10 - sort by Value.
• Sort_order1 is -1 - descending, i.e. from highest to lowest.


RANK Function:
➤ Returns the rank of a number in a list of numbers. The rank of a number is its size relative to other values in a list. (If you were to sort the list, the rank of the number would be its position.)
Syntax: RANK(number, ref, [order])
The RANK function syntax has the following arguments:
Number (Required). The number whose rank you want to find.
Ref (Required). An array of, or a reference to, a list of numbers. Nonnumeric values in ref are ignored.
Order (Optional). A number specifying how to rank number.
If order is 0 (zero) or omitted, Microsoft Excel ranks number as if ref were a list sorted in descending order. If order is any nonzero value, Microsoft Excel ranks number as if ref were a list sorted in ascending order.
Formula:
=Rank(A2,$A$2:$A$8,1)
=Rank(A2,$A$2:$A$8,0)
