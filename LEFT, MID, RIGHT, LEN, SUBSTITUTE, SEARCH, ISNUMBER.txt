**LEFT, MID, RIGHT, LEN, SUBSTITUTE, SEARCH, ISNUMBER**

**LEFT Function in Excel:**
> The LEFT function is used to retrieve a chosen amount of characters, counting from the left side of an Excel cell. The chosen number has to be greater than 0 and is set to 1 by default.
Syntax: =LEFT (text,[num_chars])
> The LEFT function uses the following arguments:
> Text (required argument) – This is the original text string.
> Num_chars (optional argument) – Specifies the number of characters to be returned from the start of the given text. It is the number of characters to be extracted, starting from the left side of the text. If we omit the argument, the default value of 1 is taken.
> If you want to use the function on a single cell, write:
  o =LEFT (cell)
> If you want to use the function on a range of cells, write:
  o =LEFT(start cell:end cell)
1. How to Use LEFT Function:
> To retrieve values from the left side of an Excel cell, use LEFT

Step 1) Start and Enter the Values by using LEFT function
> Select a cell E2
> Type =LEFT
> Select a cell (A2)
> Hit enter
> =LEFT(A2)

2. How to Use the LEFT Function with a Defined Length of Characters
1) Select cells and set the number of characters by using LEFT function
1. Select a cell E2
2. Type =LEFT
2) Enter the cell name (A2) and define the length of characters you want to retrieve, using a , as a delimiter (A2,3)
3. Hit enter
> =LEFT(A2;3)
> The function returns the first 3 characters from cell A2.

**MID Function in Excel:**
> Generally speaking, the MID function in Excel is designed to pull a substring
from the middle of the original text string.
> The Excel MID function has the following arguments:
> = MID(text, start_num, num_chars)
Where:
* Text is the original text string.
* Start_num is the position of the first character that you want to extract.
* Num_chars is the number of characters to extract.
All 3 arguments are required.
1. For example, to pull 3 characters from the text string in A2, starting with the 2nd character, use this formula:
=MID (A2;2;3)

2. MID formula to get the first name and Last name:
1. =MID(D2;1;SEARCH(" ";D2))
2. =(MID(D2;SEARCH(" ";D2);LEN(D2)))

**RIGHT Function:**
> The function will return a specified number of characters from the end of a given text string.
> In doing financial analysis, the RIGHT function can be useful if we wish to extract characters from the right side of a text string. Generally, it is used by combining it with other functions such as VALUE, SUM, COUNT, DATE, DAY, etc.
Syntax: =RIGHT (text,[num_chars])

The RIGHT function uses the following arguments:
1. Text (required argument) – This is the original text string.
2. Num_chars (optional argument) – Specifies the number of characters to be returned from the end of the given text. It is the number of characters to be extracted starting on the right side of the text. If we omit the argument, the default value of 1 is taken.
Example 1:
Suppose we wish to find certain characters from the data below:
> =RIGHT(A2;3)

Example 2 :
> The RIGHT function always returns a text string, even though it contains digits and looks
like a number. This is important if we wish to use the result of the function within other
functions or formulas.
> Using the VALUE function, we can ensure the number format is kept and the result is not
converted to text. we wish to separate numbers from the data below:
> BEN-2345
> JOHN-5432
> BHT-5645

1. We wish to extract the last 4 characters, the order number. The formula to use will be
> =VALUE(RIGHT(C2;4))

**LEN Function in Excel:**
LEN returns the number of characters in a text string.
Syntax: LEN (text)
> Text(Required). The text whose length you want to find. Spaces count as characters.
=LEN (A2)

**SUBSTITUTE Function in Excel:**
> Substitutes new_text for old_text in a text string. Use SUBSTITUTE when you want to replace specific text in a text string; use REPLACE when you want to replace any text that occurs in a specific location in a text string.
Syntax : =SUBSTITUTE(text, old_text, new_text, [instance_num])
The SUBSTITUTE function syntax has the following arguments:
Text(Required). The text or the reference to a cell containing text for which you want to substitute characters.
Old_text(Required). The text you want to replace.
New_text(Required). The text you want to replace old_text with.
Instance_num(Optional). Specifies which occurrence of old_text you want to replace with new_text. If you specify instance_num, only that instance of old_text is replaced. Otherwise, every occurrence of old_text in text is changed to new_text.
> Copy the example data in the following table, and paste it in cell A1 of a new Excel worksheet.
o Sales Data
o Quarter 1, 2008
o Quarter 1, 2011
FORMULA
DESCRIPTION
RESULT
=SUBSTITUTE(D2, "Sales", "Cost")
Substitutes Cost for Sales (Cost Data)
Cost Data
=SUBSTITUTE(D3, "1", "2", 1)
Substitutes first instance of "1" with "2" (Quarter 2, 2008)
Quarter 2, 2008
=SUBSTITUTE(D4, "1", "2", 3)
Substitutes third instance of "1" with "2" (Quarter 1, 2012)
Quarter 1, 2012

**SEARCH Function in Excel:** 
* The SEARCH functions locate one text string within a second text string, and return the number of the starting position of the first text string from the first character of the second text string. 
* Syntax: SEARCH(find_text,within_text,[start_num]) 
o find_text (Required). The text that you want to find. 
o within_text (Required). The text in which you want to search for the value of the find_text argument.
o start_num (Optional). The character number in the within_text argument at which you want to start searching. 
     •       For example, to find the position of the letter "n" in the word "printer", you can use the following function: 
             o =SEARCH("n","printer") ? This function returns 4 because "n" is the fourth character in the word "printer." 
   •       You can also search for words within other words. For example, the function 
           o =SEARCH("base","database")

**ISNUMBER Function:** 
* The function checks if a cell in Excel contains a number or not. It will return TRUE if the value is a number and if not, a FALSE value. 
* For example, if the given value is a text, date, or time, it will return FALSE. 
* o Syntax: =ISNUMBER (value) 
* The Excel ISNUMBER function uses the following arguments: 
* o Value (required argument) – This is the expression or value that needs to be tested. It is generally provided as a cell address. 
* o The ISNUMBER Excel function will return a logical value, which is TRUE or FALSE.
Example 1: Let’s first understand how the function behaves using the following set of data:

=ISNUMBER(A2)
